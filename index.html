      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        Personal websites have become too fancy. What's wrong with some good ol' HTML with an MS Paint repeating image as a background? Most of my <del>older</del> professors had websites like this, and I think they're pretty cool! If you know my age, you'd probably ask "why are you reminiscing back to the 90s when you were a wee little sapling barely able to crawl?" Sue  me ... I digress, this is my personal website. It's not really a CV in website form, but more of a place to represent me and things I enjoy.

        Why <em>Breezy Yeezy</em>? I'm often described as Stoic and easy-going, hence the <em>Breezy</em>. A bunch of my friends were Kanye West fans (before the fiasco), and my name, Yazeed, is close to his nickname, <em>Yeezy</em>. Mix them together, and ta-da! We got <em>Breezy Yeezy</em>

      <h1>Background</h1>
      <p>
        I got a double major in my undergrad in Electrical Engineering and Joint Mathematics-Economics and did my Master's in Computer Science. All of these choices relate to stories for the somewhat distant past.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have enjoyed Mathematics from a young age. Partially because I was relatively good at it, and partially due to its methodical approach that I was able to make sense of, as opposed to the rest of world around me. My early education wasn't bad, but it definitely wasn't ideal. Fortunately, I was born barely late enough for me to benifit from the internet's self-learning potential. In early high-shool, I was hooked to <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/yazeedalnumay">Khan Academy</a> 's gamified approach to learning. Before I finish highschool, I had reviewed and learned everything from basic math to multi-variable calculus and differential equations. The internet is amazing! I was also interested in math doodles. Inspired by creators like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/vihart">ViHart</a>, I went on my own adventures with math sketches:

      <!-- TODO: sketch samples here -->
      <p>
        I am a big fan of the 2007 class-based shooter Team Fortress 2. In my undergrad days, I used to play competitively and attended a couple of LAN events. Earlier in high school, I participated in the game's virtual economy trading with other players the virtual items of the game in bartering style trades. I analyzed the economic trends and dynamics to trade my way from an item worth 10$ all the way up to a <a href="https://backpack.tf/profiles/76561198047065785?time=1407099600">backpack worth $8,000</a> that I cashed out in 10<sup>th</sup> grade, so I think my interest in Economics is quite evident.
      </p>
      <p>
        Computers have always been a passion of mine. I've built my first PC when I was 14, and recently just built my third! That, along with my interest in mathematics, made me choose Electrical Engineering as my initial undergrad major. I specialized in Machine Learning, which brought me closer to Computer Science, in which I pursued my Master's. The antient seeds of mathematics and computing erupted once I delved more into the word of Computer Science. It become more of a hobby than a profession, to the point the point where I frequent competitive programming sites and learn obscure algorithms that I will likely never use outside of these settings.
